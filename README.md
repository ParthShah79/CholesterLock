iGEM Calgary 2023 Team Wiki README

1. Prior to pushing changes ensure proper communication with others. This means before pushing you need to let everyone know in the wiki Team's chat

2. Do NOT commit changes to view them. You can do this elsewhere. (Use a Live Server Extension on GitHub)! The only reason you should be committing changes without a live extension is to ensure the text is properly displayed.

3. For any pushes make descriptive reasons to the push. This doesn't need to be long, just enough so if it is required to revert to an older version, we can do so easily.
